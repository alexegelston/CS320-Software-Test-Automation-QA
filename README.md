# CS320-Software-Test-Automation-QA
A repository for my project from the SNHU CS320 courses' contact service files which revolved around the implementation of JUnit tests

    The very first thing you can do to ensure that software is functional and secure is to validate user input. Testing that invalid inputs will not be accepted by the compiler is the easiest way to make sure your program functions as intended and was a core concept throughout this course. To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program you need to first read what the client has written out for you as program requirements and then implement every one of those requirements in the program as you code it. Software should be designed with the end user in mind and have as simple of a user interface as possible.
